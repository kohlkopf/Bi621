### DISABILITY
Any student with a documented disability, who may anticipate needing accommodations in this course, should arrange to meet with Leslie during the first week of class.  Please request that a counselor at the Accessible Education Center send a letter verifying the disability.  The Accessible Education Center is in room 164 Oregon Hall and can be reached by e-mail: uoaec@uoregon.edu, and phone: 541-346-1155.

### STUDENT LIFE
If you need help and are not sure where to go, check out the **Office of Student Life**.  The student life staff is dedicated to helping students have the most successful experience they can while studying at the University of Oregon. The Office of Student Life staff is available to help you find solutions and resources to most issues and concerns on a drop-in basis Monday–Friday, 8:00 a.m.–noon and 1:00–5:00 p.m. In emergencies after hours and on weekends, contact the Department of Public Safety at 541-346-5444 and have an on-duty staff member paged.

### UNIVERISTY OF OREGON CRISIS CENTER
is a student-funded organization that provides students with confidential telephone crisis intervention 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The hotline number is 541-346-4488.  *“Often students believe that their issues are not “severe” enough for them to call a crisis intervention hotline.  Here at the Crisis Center, we truly believe that there is no problem too small for us.  At one time or another everyone needs a little help through a difficulty personal situation.”*

### DUTY TO REPORT
UO is committed to providing an environment free of all forms of prohibited discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual assault, domestic and dating violence and gender-based stalking. Any UO employee who becomes aware that such behavior is occurring has a duty to report that information to their supervisor or the Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity. The UO Health Center and University Counseling and Testing Center can provide assistance and have a greater ability to work confidentially with students. All UO employees are also required to report to appropriate authorities when they have reasonable cause to believe that any child with whom they come in contact has suffered abuse or any person with whom they come in contact has abused a child.

### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
You are expected to do your own work on in-class assignments, problem sets, and quizzes. You are encouraged to discuss ideas with each other and to study together, but don’t copy someone else’s work and don’t allow someone else to copy your work. All students are expected to conform to the student conduct code (can be found online at http://uodos.uoregon.edu/StudentConductandCommunityStandards/StudentConductCode/tabid/69/Default.aspx); students not in compliance will be brought to the attention of the university.
