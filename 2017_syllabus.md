### Class meetings
**MTWHF** 10AM - 12PM and 1:30PM - 4PM **B042 PSC**

### Course description
This is the first of three workshop-style courses in the summer term. In this course, you will learn basic programming skills that you can implement in biological data analysis. This course focuses on Unix shell and Python programming skills, and applies them to basic problem sets relating to parsing large files, e.g. data that is generated by next generation sequencing. Students will also learn how to manage computer resources and work in a shared user environment (HPC).

### Course goals
* Demonstrate proficiency in navigating a command line environment using Unix/Linux
* Construct a pipeline utilizing basic commands in Unix/Linux
* Write functions in Python which demonstrate basic algorithmic logic
* Understand and interpret common file formats (FASTA, FASTQ, SAM, GFF, GTF, etc)
* Perform quality assessment, filtering, and initial analysis of high throughput sequencing data
* Utilize various programs or tools to analyze data (including genome assembly)
* Explain how more complex algorithms function (using sequence alignment as an example)
* Successfully submit jobs to a computer cluster and work efficiently and within parameters of a shared user environment
* Demonstrate proficiency at reading, discussing, and critiquing primary research literature

## Course organization
### In-class assigments
During the class, you will be assigned seven in-class assignments. It is anticipated that you will be able to complete most of these during in-class lab time, but some out of class time may be required. – **30% of grade**

### Problem sets
Students will be assigned nine problem sets to complete, primarily outside of class time. – **40% of grade**

### Quizzes
There will be three quizzes during class over material covered in lectures. – **10% of grade**

### Lab notebook
Students should keep a lab notebook (either digitally or on paper) to be turned in at the end of the course. It should contain notes/comments on all your work throughout the course. This should include detailed information such as software/package version. *Jupyter Notebook is highly recommended for this.* – **5% of grade**

### Group presentations
Friday afternoons will be journal club-style group presentations on assigned papers (5% of grade). Students are responsible for reading all assigned papers, for writing up an “executive summary” for papers they are not involved in presenting (5% of grade), and for participating in discussing the paper during the journal club (5% of grade). – **15% of grade**

#### Preaparing and submitting assignments
The information required to complete all in-class assignments and problem sets will be given in class. If you find yourself googling how to write a piece of code, you are most likely going about the problem wrong. You must be able to describe how any piece of code you turn in operates.

Students are encouraged to work together and share information. Some students will have a higher skill level than others, and we encourage those students with more experience to help their peers. **However, no direct sharing of code is allowed – each student must write their own code.**

Assignments will be submitted on GitHub in the requested format. Be sure to include your name on the document. Be professional – appropriately name your files. Late assignments will not be accepted; however, we will drop your lowest scoring problem set when calculating your final grade.
